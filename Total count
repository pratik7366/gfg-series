You are given an array arr[] of positive integers and a threshold value k. For each element in the array, divide it into the minimum number of small integers such that each divided integer is less than or equal to k. Compute the total number of these integer across all elements of the array.


//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    
int totalCount(int k, vector<int>& arr ) {
    int total_Count = 0;
    
    for (int num : arr) {
        
        total_Count += (num + k - 1) / k;
    }
    
    return total_Count;

    }
};
