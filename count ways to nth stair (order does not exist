There are n stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).
Note: Order does not matter means for n = 4:- {1 2 1},{2 1 1},{1 1 2} are considered same.

// c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    int nthStair(int n) {
        int dp[n-1];
        dp[0]=1;
        dp[1]=1;
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            dp[i]=1+dp[i-2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
