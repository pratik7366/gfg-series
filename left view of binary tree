You are given the root of a binary tree. Your task is to return the left view of the binary tree. The left view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the left side.

If the tree is empty, return an empty list.



//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> leftView(Node *root) {
     
    vector<int> result;
    if (!root) return result;

    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelSize = q.size();
      
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
            Node* current = q.front();
            q.pop();

        
            if (i == 0)
                result.push_back(current->data);

            if (current->left) q.push(current->left);
            if (current->right) q.push(current->right);
        }
    }
    return result;
        
    }
};
