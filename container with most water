Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.

Note: In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.

//c++ code 
  class Solution {

  public:
    int maxWater(vector<int> &arr) {
        
    int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
    int max_area = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        int height = min(arr[left], arr[right]);
        int width = right - left;
        max_area = max(max_area, height * width);

        if (arr[left] < arr[right])
            left++;
        else
            right--;
    }

    return max_area;
    }
};
