Given an integer array coins[ ] representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum by using different combinations from coins[ ]. 
Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. Therefore, you can use any coin as many times as you want.
Answers are guaranteed to fit into a 32-bit integer





//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    int count(vector<int>& coins, int sum) {
    
    vector<int> dp(sum + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int j = coin; j <= sum; j++) {
            dp[j] += dp[j - coin];
        }
    }
    return dp[sum];
    }
};
