Given an array arr[][] such that arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.

/c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    bool canAttend(vector<vector<int>> &arr) {
        
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i][0] < arr[i - 1][1]) return false;
    }
    return true;

    }
};
