Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V nodes labeled from 0 to V-1, and a list of directed edges, count the total number of distinct paths from a given start node to a destination node. Each edge is represented as edges[i] = [u, v], indicating a directed edge from u to v.




//c++ code

class Solution {
  public:
    int dfs(int node, int dest, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& dp) {
        if (node == dest) return 1;
        if (dp[node] != -1) return dp[node];
        int count = 0;
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            count += dfs(neighbor, dest, adj, dp);
        }
        return dp[node] = count;
    }

    int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& edges, int V, int src, int dest) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        }
        vector<int> dp(V, -1);
        return dfs(src, dest, adj, dp);
    }
