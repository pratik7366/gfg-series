Given an array arr[] with repeated elements, the task is to find the maximum distance between two occurrences of an element.

Note: You may assume that every input array has repetitions.



// c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int> &arr) {

    unordered_map<int, int> first_occurrence;
    int max_dist = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (first_occurrence.find(arr[i]) == first_occurrence.end()) {
            first_occurrence[arr[i]] = i;
        } else {
            max_dist = max(max_dist, i - first_occurrence[arr[i]]);
        }
    }
    return max_dist;

    }
};
