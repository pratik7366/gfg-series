You are given two unsorted arrays a[] and b[]. Both arrays may contain duplicate elements. For each element in a[], your task is to count how many elements in b[] are less than or equal to that element.



//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> countLessEq(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
     
    sort(b.begin(), b.end());
    vector<int> result;
    for (int num : a) {
        int count = upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), num) - b.begin();
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    return result;
    }
};
