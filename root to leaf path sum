Given a binary tree, where every node value is a number. Find the sum of all the numbers that are formed from root to leaf paths. The formation of the numbers would be like 10*parent + current (see the examples for more clarification).


//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    
 int help(Node *root,int num){
        if(!root)return 0;
        num = num*10+root->data;
        if(!root->left && !root->right)return num;
        return help(root->left,num)+help(root->right,num);
    }
    int treePathsSum(Node *root) {
    
        return help(root,0);
    
    }
};
