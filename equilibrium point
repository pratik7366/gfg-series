Given an array of integers arr[], the task is to find the first equilibrium point in the array.

The equilibrium point in an array is an index (0-based indexing) such that the sum of all elements before that index is the same as the sum of elements after it. Return -1 if no such point exists. 



//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
   
    int findEquilibrium(vector<int> &arr) {
        
    int totalSum = 0, leftSum = 0;
    for (int num : arr) totalSum += num;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        totalSum -= arr[i];
        if (leftSum == totalSum) return i;
        leftSum += arr[i];
    }
    return -1;
    }
};
