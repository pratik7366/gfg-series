Given an undirected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges, represented by 2d array edges[][], where edges[i]=[u,v] represents the edge between the vertices u and v. Determine whether a specific edge between two vertices (c, d) is a bridge.

Note:

An edge is called a bridge if removing it increases the number of connected components of the graph.
if thereâ€™s only one path between c and d (which is the edge itself), then that edge is a bridge.




//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    
void dfs(int u, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
    visited[u] = true;
    for (int v : adj[u]) {
        if (!visited[v]) dfs(v, adj, visited);
    }
}

bool isBridge(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int c, int d) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
    for (auto& e : edges) {
        if ((e[0] == c && e[1] == d) || (e[0] == d && e[1] == c)) continue;
        adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
        adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
    }
    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
    dfs(c, adj, visited);
    return !visited[d];
        
    }
};
