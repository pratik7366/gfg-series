Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], we need to find the kth positive number that is missing from arr[].  


//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    int kthMissing(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        
    int missing = 0, prev = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        int diff = num - prev - 1;
        if (missing + diff >= k) return prev + k - missing;
        missing += diff;
        prev = num;
    }
    return arr.back()  +k - missing;
    }
};
