Given a number represented as a string s (which may be very large), check whether it is divisible by 13 or not.


//c++ code 


class Solution {
  public:
    bool divby13(string &s) {
        
    int remainder = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        remainder = (remainder * 10 + (c - '0')) % 13;
    }
    return remainder == 0;
        
    }
};
