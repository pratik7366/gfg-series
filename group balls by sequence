You are given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each element arr[i] represents the number written on the i-th ball, and a positive integer k.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange all the balls into groups such that:


Each group contains exactly k balls.
The numbers in each group are consecutive integers





//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    bool validgroup(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
  
        if (arr.size() % k != 0) return false;

        map<int, int> freq;
        for (int num : arr) freq[num]++;

        for (map<int, int>::iterator it = freq.begin(); it != freq.end(); ++it) {
            int num = it->first;
            int count = it->second;

            if (count > 0) {
                for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
                    if (freq[num + i] < count) return false;
                    freq[num + i] -= count;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
