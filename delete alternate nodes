Given a Singly Linked List, Delete all alternate nodes of the list ie delete all the nodes present in even positions.


// c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    void deleteAlt(struct Node *head) {
        

    if (!head) return;
    Node* current = head;
    while (current && current->next) {
        Node* temp = current->next;
        current->next = current->next->next;
        delete temp;
        current = current->next;
    }
}

void printList(Node* head) {
    while (head) {
        cout << head->data << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << endl;


    }
};
