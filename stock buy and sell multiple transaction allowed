The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    int maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
    int n = prices.size();
    int maxProfit = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
    }
    return maxProfit;
    }
};
