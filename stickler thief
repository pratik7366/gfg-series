Stickler the thief wants to loot money from the houses arranged in a line. He cannot loot two consecutive houses and aims to maximize his total loot.
Given an array, arr[] where arr[i] represents the amount of money in the i-th house.
Determine the maximum amount he can loot.




//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    int findMaxSum(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    if (n == 1) return arr[0];
    int prev2 = 0, prev1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int curr = max(prev1, prev2 + arr[i]);
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = curr;
    }
    return prev1;
        
    }
};
