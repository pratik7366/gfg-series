Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.



//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    
    int getCount(struct Node* head) {

        
    int count = 0;
    while (head != nullptr) {
        count++;
        head = head->next;
    }
    return count;

    }
};
