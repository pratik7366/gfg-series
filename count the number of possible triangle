Given an integer array arr[]. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of the triangle. 

A triangle with three given sides is only possible if sum of any two sides is always greater than the third side.



//c++ code

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to count the number of possible triangles.
    int countTriangles(vector<int>& arr) {
    
    int n = arr.size();
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
        int left = 0, right = i - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (arr[left] + arr[right] > arr[i]) {
                count += (right - left);
                right--;
            } else {
                left++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
    }
};
