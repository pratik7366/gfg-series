Given an array of integers cost[] where cost[i] is the cost of the ith step on a staircase. Once the cost is paid, you can either climb one or two steps. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
Assume 0-based Indexing. You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.




//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
    
    int n = cost.size();
    int prev2 = cost[0];
    int prev1 = cost[1];
    
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        int curr = cost[i] + min(prev1, prev2);
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = curr;
    }
    
    return min(prev1, prev2);
    }
};
