You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.
You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

 
 //c++ code 
 
 class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
    
    int imbalance = 0, maxImbalance = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '[') {
            imbalance--;
        } else {
            imbalance++;
        }
        maxImbalance = max(maxImbalance, imbalance);
    }
    return (maxImbalance + 1) / 2;
 
    }
};
