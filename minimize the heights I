Given a positive integer k and an array arr[] denoting heights of towers, you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by k only once.
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have modified each tower.

//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    int getMinDiff(int k, vector<int> &arr) {
    
    int n = arr.size();
    if (n == 1) return 0;
    
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int result = arr[n - 1] - arr[0];
    int smallest = arr[0] + k;
    int largest = arr[n - 1] - k;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int minHeight = min(smallest, arr[i + 1] - k);
        int maxHeight = max(largest, arr[i] + k);
        result = min(result, maxHeight - minHeight);
    }
    return result;
    }
};
