A sorted array of distinct elements arr[] is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it. 
//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& arr) {
        
    int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] > arr[right])
            left = mid + 1;
        else
            right = mid;
    }
    
    return arr[left];
    }
};
