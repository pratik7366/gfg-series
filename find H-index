Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.

H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.


//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        
    sort(citations.rbegin(), citations.rend());
    int h = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); ++i) {
        if (citations[i] >= i + 1) {
            h = i + 1;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return h;
    }
};
