Given a unsorted array arr[] of positive integers having all the numbers occurring exactly twice, except for one number which will occur only once. Find the number occurring only once.




//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    int findUnique(vector<int> &arr) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        result ^= num;
    }
    return result;
        
    }
};
