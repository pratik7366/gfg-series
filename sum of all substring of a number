Given an integer s represented as a string, the task is to get the sum of all possible sub-strings of this string.

Note: The number may have leading zeros.
It is guaranteed that the total sum will fit within a 32-bit signed integer.






//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    int sumSubstrings(string &s) {
    
    int n = s.length();
    int res = s[0] - '0';
    int prev = res;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int num = s[i] - '0';
        prev = prev * 10 + num * (i + 1);
        res += prev;
    }
    return res;

        
    }
};
