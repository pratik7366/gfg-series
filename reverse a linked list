Given the head of a linked list, the task is to reverse this list and return the reversed head.


//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    Node* reverseList(struct Node* head) {
             
          if (head == NULL)
              return NULL;
          Node *prev = NULL;
          Node *current = head;
          Node *next = current->next;
  
          while (current != NULL) {
              next = current->next;
              current->next = prev;  
              prev = current;
              current = next;
          }
  
          return prev;
    }
};
