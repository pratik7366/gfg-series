Given two integer values n and r, the task is to find the value of Binomial Coefficient nCr

A binomial coefficient nCr can be defined as the coefficient of xr in the expansion of (1 + x)n that gives the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects without considering the order.
The binomial coefficient nCr is calculated as : C(n,r) = n! / r! * (n-r) !
Note: If r is greater than n, return 0.
It is guaranteed that the value of nCr will fit within a 32-bit integer.




//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    int nCr(int n, int r) {
     
        if (r > n) return 0;
        if (r == 0 || r == n) return 1;

        if (r > n - r) r = n - r;  
        long long res = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i) {
            res = res * (n - i);
            res = res / (i + 1);
        }

        return static_cast<int>(res);
    }
};
