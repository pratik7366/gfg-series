There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Your task is to count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).



//c++ code 

class Solution {
  public:
    int countWays(int n) {

    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    vector<int> dp(n + 1);
    dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    return dp[n];
        
    }
};
