You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.




//c++ code 


class Solution {
  public:
    
        int missingNum(const vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size() + 1;
    long long total = 1LL * n * (n + 1) / 2;
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        sum += num;
    }
    return total - sum;
        
    }
};
