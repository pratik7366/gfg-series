Given a number n, Your task is to swap the two nibbles and find the resulting number. 

A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet. There are two nibbles in a byte. For example, the decimal number 150 is represented as 10010110 in an 8-bit byte. This byte can be divided into two nibbles: 1001 and 0110.





//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
  
int swapNibbles(int n) {
    return ((n & 0x0F) << 4) | ((n & 0xF0) >> 4);
}

int main() {
    int n1 = 100;
    int n2 = 129;

    swapNibbles(n1); // 70
    swapNibbles(n2); // 24

    return 0;

    }
};
