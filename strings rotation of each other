You are given two strings of equal lengths, s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

Note: The characters in the strings are in lowercase.



//c++ code 
class Solution {
  public:
    bool areRotations(string &s1, string &s2) {
    if (s1.size() != s2.size()) 
    return false;
    string temp = s1 + s1;
    return temp.find(s2) != string::npos; 
    }
};
